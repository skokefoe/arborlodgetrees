We hope you'll join us and meet your fellow tree-loving neighbors to build community and grow our canopy. We'll have experts on-hand to answer questions and chat while we enjoy food and drink from this restaurant in our neighborhood. We'll be joined by Paul Koberstein, a longtime staff writer for The Oregonian, Willamette Week, and editor of Cascadia Times, a website of 'journalism on behalf of the planet.' Paul lives in Overlook and will share a few words on his book, Canopy of Titans: The Life and Times of the Great North American Temperate Rainforest, a finalist for the 2024 Oregon Book Awards. We hope to see you there! And if you'd like to get more involved with our Tree Team, we meet the second Wednesday of every month.
